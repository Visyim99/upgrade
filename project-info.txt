ppapp.js contains the functionality for the front end. It calls web services that are defined in routes.php in the Laravel framework.

- The app doesn't hit the live data. The changes are written to a table on the web server, then some programs are scheduled to run nightly to update things.
- Nightly Process (Run on county server):
	- Run Dave's Update.exe. This updates the tables that the website uses to display the user's current information.
	- Run Danny Britt's .bat script. This script does several things:
		- Backs up tables created by previous exe.
		- Uploads backup to rsync
		- Calls a url on the online dec site
			- Gets the backup from rsync and restores it
			- Iterates through changes that haven't been marked as "done"
				- Gets corresponding user for change record, if they have a ProcessedDate, mark the change record as "done"
			- Backs up changes table and uploads to rsync
		- Gets changes backup from rsync and restores to local db
	- Run Dave's Update2.exe. This processes the changes and creates the online dec images


NOTE: This app requires that browscap be configured in php.ini. This allows the app to detect browser versions since this site does not work on IE 7 or lower.

Copy full_php_browscap.ini to php directory. EX: *\PHP\v5.6\extras\full_php_browscap.ini

Uncomment browscap line from php.ini. Add location to browscap file. Ex: browscap = "C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\v5.6\extras\full_php_browscap.ini"


This app also requires URL Rewrite. Install via web platform installer in IIS
